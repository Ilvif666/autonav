In this exercise goal is to compute the position of the quadrotor from 
observations of visual markers. The markers are detected in images 
recorded from the downfacing camera of the quadrotor. We also assume the 
position of the markers in the world are known.

The following image illustrates the relations between the the world, 
quadrotor and marker coordinate frames.

The transformations from the world to the marker Tmw and from the 
quadrotor to the marker Tmq are known. Task is to compute the 
transformation from the world to the quadrotor Tqw given the two other 
transformations.  Function compute_drone_pose parameters are the 
global marker pose and the observed marker pose . Both are instances of 
the Pose3D class. And it returns quadrotor Tqw transformation.
