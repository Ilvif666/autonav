In this exercise we placed several beacons in the world. Your task is to stear the quadrotor through each of them. The order in which you pass through the beacons does not matter. Instead of flying manually we provide a simple interface to specify a series of motion commands.

Below the simulation window is a python code editor where you can define the motion commands inside the plan_mission function. Create a list of motion commands using the following functions defined in the quadrotor.command package.

forward(x) - move x meters forward
backward(x) - move x meters backward
left(x) - move x meters to the left
right(x) - move x meters to the right
up(x) - move x meters up
down(x) - move x meters down
turn_left(x) - turn x degrees to the left
turn_right(x) - turn x degrees to the right
Afterwards add the commands to the mission using mission.add_commands(commands).
